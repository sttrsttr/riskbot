How to set up riskbot on your own host:

Have NPM installed:

Install required node modules

	npm install

Create an riskbot_config.json file with the following content:
(remember to add your own token and clientId, and adjust for wha servers the bot should be interacting with)
(a lot of commands needs access to the closed M2M API at Friends of Risk to work)
(edit deply-commands.js accordingly to your server and command needs)

{
"token": "",
"clientId": "",
"guilds": {
    "GMARENA": "776142718425497640",
    "RISKDEV": "796769248444809266",
    "MAIN": "465846009164070912",
    "RETRYGAMES": "681626969670156320",
},
"for_api_key":
"mainserver_noevents_role":


To make the bot run continuisuly use one of two recommended strategies:

A) Set up pm2

    npm install -g pm2
    pm2 start riskbot.js --name riskbot
    pm2 startup
    pm2 save

or 

B) Set up CRON-JOB to restart bot every 24 hours, add this line to your user crontab: (if you dont run on a linux server, there may be other tools than cron to handle this)
	
	1 15 * * * sh reboot_riskbot.sh
